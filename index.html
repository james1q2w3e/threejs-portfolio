        <h2>Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          My journey began at an early age, taking apart old computers and electronic devices to get an understanding of the inner workings. This interest in hardware eventually led to an interest in software, leading me to seek a career in software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Towards the beginning of 2022, I decided to finally put in effort to accomplish my goal and land a career in software development. I had already spent a year in college to major in computer science, but I wanted to get an accelerated start in the world of software development. So I enrolled in a four-month fullstack academy bootcamp at Fullstack Academy.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Dec. 2022, I graduated from Fullstack Academy and obtained my certification for Web Development and Software Engineering. I am now looking forward to joining the professional career path of being a software developer.

        <h2> Projects</h2>

        <h4>The Dark Room</h4>
        <p>
          Collaborated with a group of developers to make a small horror-dungeon-crawler using Phaser 3 and Typescript. There were times we worked off of a single page of documentation for some of the concepts we used; raycasting proved to be the most challenging in this regard.
